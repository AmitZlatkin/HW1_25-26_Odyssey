# Git Introduction!

Hello Matam Students!!
This is the git introduction part, you'll need to adjust this file and push it to a git repository of yours!
To make things a bit more fun, each TA added a link to a song/video we would like you to hear/watch, and we would like to hear which song you liked the most.
